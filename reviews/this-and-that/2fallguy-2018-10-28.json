Didn't expect too much.\nBeen eating there at least once a month since 1997 & the food is great. I was brought up on South Indian food but really prefer Gujarati or Punjabi style (don't tell my Ma!).\nThe owner, Ishmael Malu, is a really nice guy and his son and staff too. Unfortunately, I called him Mr Alu for a long time before he gently corrected me (thought it was an odd name!).\nWe don't have similar eating places here in Liverpool where the local *Indian* restaurants seem to cook for drunk people -This & That caters for hungry people. Try it!","date":"2018-10-28T20:20:36.625Z"}
