You were professional from the start providing all the relevant information needed, being on time, lovely charming staff and being a part of our event. The Spider Mountain and rock climbing wall was very popular with our guests and i would highly recommend it and DB Entertainment.\nPlease pass on my thanks to your staff.\n\nWilliam Sweeting\nWilliam’s Den",
