First place I visited when I arrived in Manchester, after seeing it recommended a lot online! What a welcome!!! Lovely staff, happy to chat and had lots of regulars - always a good sign! The food was SO tasty. Best keema curry I've ever tried. I had rice and three (2 meat and 1 veg) and a veg samosa - it was divine. Would go back in a heartbeat!\nP.s. Such great value!!!","date":"2025-08-18T13:54:53.329Z"}
