  "content": "PA system and bouncy castle - super easy super fun.\n\nWe loaned a PA system and bouncy castle for our wedding. DB Team were great. There was so much choice and a special offer if you spent a certain amount. We had some hiccups with the venue, but DB were patient, and when it looked like we might not be able to have a bouncy castle offered alternatives. On the day all went according to plan, they set up everything, and were back on time as promised. Was blown away by the speaker quality and the children loved the bouncy castle. One piece of feedback (unless I missed it) wireless microphone(s) with the PA would have been a lot better, but I think they can be less reliable. Super easy organising drop off, again very understanding and accommodating. Have made me want to organise more events now I've seen how easy it can be!",
