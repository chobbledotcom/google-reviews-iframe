You have a plate of rice then you choose three of the set menu curries to put on top. They are all made very mild as you add your own chilli and coriander after you buy it. It is also cheap, no fancy trimmings, just a canteen vibe and lovely staff and excellent food. The menu is set and is at the end of the servers bar printed on glass, which shows you how much it doesn't change.","date":"2021-09-11T20:00:29.164Z"}
