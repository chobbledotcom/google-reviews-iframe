So much different to the taste of Indian food in NL (where we come from). So cheap. Good portion. Quick.\nI can eat there every day I guess.\nYou can choose meals of choice (rice with one meat and two vegetables or rice with 3 meats dishes, etc). The place is small, but we didn't face problems eating lunch there with 7 of us.\nThe meals are at least medium spicy. So not suitable for young children.\nRecommended!","date":"2024-02-19T16:16:17.214Z"}
