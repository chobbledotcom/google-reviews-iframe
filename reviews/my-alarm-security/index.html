        <div class="review-content">Our two years experience with Matt and Rachel of MyAlarm Security is entirely positive. Matt is a highly professional,  experienced and kind man who takes the trouble to explain in detail various aspects of his security system. We are very glad that we have chosen his company to take care of the security of our home. We would recommend Matt and his company to anyone wishing to have a reliable domestic security system. Thank you Matt and Rachel for your hard work!</div>

        <div class="review-content">Matt came to fix a fault with my Mum's house alarm, and I can't recommend this company enough. It would have been easy for a company to come in and try to up-sell my elderly mum a new alarm system or take advantage, but Matt found and fixed the fault quickly, and also gave her some helpful tips on how to use the alarm properly (which we had been doing wrong for the last 18 years!) I was hesitant about getting a company in to look at the alarm, but I needn't have worried - I would 100% recommend this company, especially for those who are elderly or vulnerable. They are a family run business, and are both trustworthy and reliable. Thank you!</div>

        <div class="review-content">We recently had an alarm system installed by My Alarm Security, and we couldn’t be happier with the service. Matt and his team were incredibly efficient, professional, and took the time to tailor the installation to our specific needs. The pricing was very competitive, and the whole process was smooth from start to finish. We now feel much more secure in our home, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable home security solution. Thanks again!</div>

        <div class="review-content">Our experience with MyAlarm Security was entirely positive. Matt was able to come round the day after we phoned, explained everything very clearly and even brought a demonstration pack so we could see the equipment. He gave an on the spot quote which was significantly lower than another local company and was able to fit the security system the following week. He was very knowledgeable, professional and friendly, and the fitting process was clean and efficient. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend MyAlarm and are very happy we decided to use their service. Thanks Matt and Rachel.</div>

        <div class="review-content">I would highly recommend MyAlarm Security services. I needed to get my alarm serviced. I found MyAlarm Security’s details on the website as one of the local company around Bexley. I had also come across a recommendation on Nextdoor app for the same company. Therefore, I gave Matt a call and explained the service that I needed. He understood my requirements and provided clear communication. We agreed on the price for servicing my house alarm which was reasonable and competitive amongst the other providers. Matt came around the same day and did the job to my satisfaction. He is knowledgeable in his area of expertise and knows what he is doing. He did a walk through of the alarm system which was helpful. Overall, Matt is professional, friendly and does a good quality job. Hence, I am happy to recommend his services based on my experience.</div>

Good system and good value, considering it is a professionally installed alarm rather than a DIY kit and not got silly ongoing monthly costs. Would definitely recommend.</div>

        <div class="review-content">Choosing the system I needed was straightforward as the website was set out so clearly and concisely, including the cost. As I was self-isolating, the survey was carried out via facetime, which was perfect.
On the day of fitting, Matt arrived exactly at the time he said he would and was very organised. Once the alarm was fitted, he was so patient too as he helped me set up the app on my phone and made absolutely sure that I was confident in arming/disarming the system. I cannot fault the service I received.</div>

Matt was very professional, he listened to what we wanted from our CCTV and Alarm installation and was very helpful with his recommendations. The work was carried out without any hassle and we are very pleased with the product. This is a family run business, so no middle man or franchise, but the level of care and professionalism was second to none. The after sales service is superb, and we would highly recommend Matt and MyAlarm. You will not be disappointed.</div>

        <div class="review-content">We spent a lot of time researching a new burglar alarm system and are very pleased we chose MyAlarm.     Matt spent a lot of time explaining all options available and we chose the alarm with full HD cctv.    Matt carried out the installation a week later with great respect to our home and fittings.      Work was completed inside of a day, after which Matt cleared up the minimal mess made through drilling etc and although quite late in the afternoon, spent a lot of time fully explaining how to operate the alarm and Cctv.     A first class product and installation by Matt and is highly recommended.</div>

        <div class="review-content">True story, the wheel in my van fell off the other day, literally fell off while I was driving...
I ended up waiting 34 hours to be recovered because I wasn’t covered properly.
I sorted out break down cover the next day (Little good it did me at the time, though!).
I decided rather than wait till I was burgled, I’d ask Matt to sort my home security.
I don’t want to wait till my home is broken in to before I then sort that out, too!
My wife and children are far more important than my van!
It’s always after the fact or post issue that I get things sorted, but this is too important.
Matt was round quickly and scoped everything out. Wasn’t a massive quote at all, was really pleased with it, and all getting done very soon.
Couldn’t be happier.</div>
