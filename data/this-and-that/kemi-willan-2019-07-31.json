I couldn't possibly say enough good things about this restaurant, it is one of my favourite places and arguably the best curry in Manchester! I have eaten here more times than I could count, at some points twice in the same week! Amazing quality and GREAT value for money.","date":"2019-07-31T21:55:43.865Z"}
