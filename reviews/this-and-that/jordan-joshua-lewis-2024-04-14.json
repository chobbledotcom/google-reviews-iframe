Every curry on selection is insanely delicious with the bread and samosas being cheap additions to fill you up.\n\nWe went for a takeout this weekend and for 2 x decent sized curries with 2 large breads it was just £17. And you KNOW it's gonna hit the spot unlike some takeaways.\n\nIt's chaotic inside sometimes, some staff are a little blunt but it's not in a bad way. It adds to the good vibe in some unexplainable way.","date":"2024-04-14T16:39:51.950Z"}
