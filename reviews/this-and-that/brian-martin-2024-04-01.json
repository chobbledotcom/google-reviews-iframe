The food was delicious and the price was surprisingly cheap for what you would expect of quality Indian food. The customer service was fantastic as well as the staff are very welcoming and friendly. I was going to just order chicken tikka masala but the staff recommended I order the 3 meat for roughly the same price and I’m so glad I did because the mix of favors on the plate were incredible. Be sure to order the Lamb Mince Keema while you’re at it because I would’ve made the mistake of not getting it due to ignorance and it was great. Do yourself a favor and stop by This & That. You won’t regret it.","date":"2024-04-01T18:07:36.209Z"}
