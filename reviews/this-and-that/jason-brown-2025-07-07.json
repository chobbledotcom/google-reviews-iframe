I was directed to Mo, the owner of this and that and I was not disappointed. Mo was incredibly welcoming, friendly and his food is delicious, by his own admission, it's a no frills place but there is a reason it has been here for 40 years! The restaurant support the local homeless community on a Thursday evening too.\nAbsolutely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed.","date":"2025-07-07T19:23:40.221Z"}
