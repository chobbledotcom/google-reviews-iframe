When we followed the directions to find this place we thought we may have been lost since the entrance is in a little alleyway behind another restaurant. But we smelled the amazing food so we walked a little further and found the entrance. The menu is on the wall with all of the amazing choices that are offered on each day of the week. We ended up sharing because we only had 10 pounds and it's cash only. The staff were very friendly, the food was delicious, and the prices were more than fair. We will definitely be returning!","date":"2023-02-01T09:23:52.625Z"}
