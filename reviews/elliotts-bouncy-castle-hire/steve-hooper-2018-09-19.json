  "content": "Absolutely brilliant service from start to finish. We originally hired 1 castle and 2 bounce slides for our Charity Fun Day in New Ash Green (16/09/18), but due to H&S issues we wanted to cancel the castle and change it for some soft play stuff and bouncy unicorns, this was days before the event, but they were really helpful and manage to change it with no issues. The kids had a great time. I was walked around each slide and was told what I need to look for in terms of safety etc. Great service, great slides and great price. Would definitely recommend.",
