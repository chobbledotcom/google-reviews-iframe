Had 3 curries - chicken tikka masala, mutton kheema and potato cauliflower curry with rice and finished with mango lassi. There was a lot of flavour in curries! Could taste different kinds of spices but not spicy at all. Mutton kheema was really good and Mango lassi was perfect for a sweet and cool drink after a satisfying meal !! One plate of 3 curry and rice with Lassi was filling for 2 people!","date":"2022-03-03T18:18:19.992Z"}
