  "content": "We were attracted by the relatively high review score (4.7 after more than 2000 reviews).  What makes it worthwhile is that you'll have a generous portion of decent food for a ridiculously reasonable price.  The selection varies daily, but that great price for the rice and three (curries) is constant.  All the curries we tried were decent but not outstanding, but the price cannot be beat.  Listening to the patrons and the warm greetings of the staff, it is obvious that many diners make it a regular stop. Michelin star? Nope. But a filling meal at an unmatched price - count me in.\nNovember 29, 2025\nC&J",
