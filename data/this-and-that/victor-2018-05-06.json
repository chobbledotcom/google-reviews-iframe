I've had chana on many occasions before but the way this place layers the spice mix is next level. The owner (?) Is very friendly and makes great conversation. He saw that we were new to the city and offered us two delicious cups of mango lassi. Definitely worth a visit!","date":"2018-05-06T12:00:53.936Z"}
