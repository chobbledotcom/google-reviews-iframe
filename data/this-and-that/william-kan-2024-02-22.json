Peeping in thru the window and found that it was almost full so I decided to give it a try.  Took a few moment to understand the menu on the wall, the food they offered is fixed for the day and changes daily, you just pick 2-3 dish to go with rice or naan.  They certainly don't market it as a \"decent\" restaurant, the food is of good value though.","date":"2024-02-22T12:24:42.341Z"}
