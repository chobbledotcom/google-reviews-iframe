The Nihari dish is just to Die for! It's so tiny, it only seats about 20 people (if that!) in one sitting and yet it's ALWAYS busy, full and popular. A little hard to find if you don't already know where it is as it's down the back alleys of Manchester, near Shudehill. If you do find it, tho', you're in for a TREAT! Looking for this little Jewel is like going on a a Treasure Hunt and it is the Treasure! Well worth finding!","date":"2018-08-27T20:23:16.116Z"}
