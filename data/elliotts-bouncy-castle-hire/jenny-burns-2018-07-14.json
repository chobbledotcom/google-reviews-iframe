From the point of first contact to collection of the equipment at the end of the party I experienced a friendly, informative and professional service that was a pleasure to deal with.  Sarah helped me choose equipment needed and answered all queries and concerns that I had.  The equipment was brilliant - clean and unworn.  I had complete faith and confidence in their knowledge, skill and ability to provide safe inflatables for the party.  I couldn't recommend this company enough, I shall surely be calling upon their services in the future.\nThank you Sarah and Spencer for helping make 24 kids very happy.",
