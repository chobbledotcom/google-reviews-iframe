Upon hiring a venue with an incredibly low ceiling height, I was assisted with a last minute change to the castle hired, which also complimented my theme. I would not hesitate to  Highly recommend this wonderful business to all, for your celebrations requirements. Thank you you contributed to Alfie having a fab 5th Birthday Party �",
