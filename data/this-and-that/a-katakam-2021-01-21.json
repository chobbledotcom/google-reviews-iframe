The people behind are excellent.  They may seem cold but understand they are busy. Visit after the rush hour, they are very friendly and warm. In fact they had made fresh kababs just for us. Prices are very reasonable. We visited during Cricket World cup (Jun '19) from USA and we still have good memories of this place.","date":"2021-01-21T22:28:50.733Z"}
