I was greeted by genuinely one of the most friendly fellows in the casual-Indian-food industry, who was more than happy to cure my decision paralysis by ordering me what he (correctly) thought I would like, and also tossed in a free garlic naan bread. This place is apparently famous for the competitively-priced and generously-portioned three curries-one rice deal, in which I most enjoyably partook. The setting is low-key and happy-coloured (which I would take any day over the dull, chic palate that most modern places seem to be adopting), and the long tables mean that you may have to seat yourself beside a stranger and overhear an intense discussion about their relationship issues with Kieran, who sounds like he probably just needs some space right now, but it's not your place to say - just eat your three curries, carefully apportioning your supply of basmati rice, and run. The place was dotted with little groups of such voraciously chatting locals, and you may feel as if you wandered into a university cafeteria. Bonus points for the mural with the Bolton Wanderers emblem enlarged beside the other lesser-historied Manchester teams.","date":"2023-08-07T14:34:12.051Z"}
