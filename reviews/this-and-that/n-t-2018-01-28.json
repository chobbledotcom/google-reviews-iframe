The tastiest and most affordable Asian/Indian food around. The staff is lovely and very quick.\nGood options from both vegetarian and meat dishes to select from. You order at the counter by selecting dishes and then pay for your food. You can then select the salad and garnishing for your food and then take the food plate, cutlery and napkins along with the jug of water etc to your table. This place never disappoints! Remember it’s cash only !","date":"2018-01-28T01:19:28.347Z"}
