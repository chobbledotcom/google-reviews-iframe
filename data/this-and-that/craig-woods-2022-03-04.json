Probably the best curry you will manage to find in the Northern Quarter if not the whole of Manchester. If you are visiting this has to be on your list. If you live here and haven't been, what's up with you? Go!  Food is delicious, service is amazing and you will be shocked at the price. Well worth the money.","date":"2022-03-04T20:02:23.613Z"}
