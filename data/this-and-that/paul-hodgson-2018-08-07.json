Got there at quarter past 4 on Monday on our way to the Iron Maiden concert. A full, and I mean full, plate of 4 curries with rice for £5.50. It's no frills but it doesn't need any, the food speaks for itself. Quite tricky to find, but worth persevering for.  I'll be back.","date":"2018-08-07T08:44:55.967Z"}
