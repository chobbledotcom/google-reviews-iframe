Decided to give it a go. Tucked away down a side alley it is easy to miss. The rice plus three curries ranges from £6 for 3 veggie dishes to £8 for three meat dishes. (Or have one selection 3x!)  The choice of 8 or 9 dishes is set by day. Chicken curry and Keema seems to be on the menu every day. The lamb dish varies. There is a fish dish one day and a lamb and kidney on a Wednesday. Had two meals, a good naan and a can of coke for £20. All very good. A sociable shared eating space. Really enjoyed Ic buying our meal as his Advent Calendar Christmas present. Hard to find better value.","date":"2024-08-09T13:56:28.137Z"}
