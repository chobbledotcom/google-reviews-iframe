Shame I don't work in Manchester anymore otherwise I'd be in here 3 times a week. My only place for lunch when I'm in town.  My favourite day is Tuesday, but you'll find something each day to tantalise your taste buds.  Staff are really friendly and the food is great. Get there soon. You'll enjoy!","date":"2017-07-31T16:55:25.863Z"}
