  "content": "Amazing hearty Pakistani food that is unbelievable value for money. You can go for a rice + 3 curry situation of various types. Samosas are lovely as well as the naans. Service is very friendly too. No frills, go up and get what you want and pay at the end. The curries aren’t the best curries ever but for what you pay they are good and the portions are huge. I definitely recommend and would come back here again.",
