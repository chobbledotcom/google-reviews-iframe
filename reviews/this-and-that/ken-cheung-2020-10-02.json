Though I’ve only been in only a couple of times as I’m travelling from Glasgow the staff are genuinely nice people.\n\nIt’s not just about money in this place as they can charge more than what they are charging as it is completely worth it. I’ve a feeling they’re doing this for the community they are in so more people can afford it.\n\nWhile walking past other shops that are quiet which is a shame in these COVID stricken times ,there is a slow steady stream of customers coming into this establishment.\nMaybe not just for the food I’ve witnessed but for the natter and feeling of family you get from mo and Ismail.\n\nI’m pretty well travelled and have ate in a lot of places but the kebab here must be one of the best value ones in the uk. None of that mushed fake Lamb gubbins they serve elsewhere but here it’s proper meat that’s been cooked on a skewer then chargrilled.\n\nWill be back.","date":"2020-10-02T08:32:30.618Z"}
