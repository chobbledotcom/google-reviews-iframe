I reckon I've been to many different Indian restaurants or curry houses before in Manchester but I would say this little hidden canteen-like curry house might be my favourite now. The chicken curry and tikka masala I had were so tasty and unique, and the spinach and vegs were nice as well with rice. All of these including a can were just £8.50 absolutely worth it.",
