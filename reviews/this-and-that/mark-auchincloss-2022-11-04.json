Food was fine freshly prepared although the spinach was too spicy for us. They don't have any beer only soft drinks. Off beat rundown sidestreet and quite small, quirky curry house. Biggest attribute is it's great value for money. Mango soft drink was excellent too.","date":"2022-11-04T22:30:39.314Z"}
