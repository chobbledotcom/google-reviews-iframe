The outside is quite unassuming and down an alley which, at night, can be scary and uninviting. However, once you get inside you're greeted with welcoming faces and delicious smelling food. It has a very informal canteen style atmosphere where you order at the front and find yourself a seat on a bench after.\n\nThe menu changes every day (look at the website for what's on that day) and the prices are very reasonable considering the portions are generous. I had rice with 2 meat and 1 veg, all of which was absolutely delicious! I was very full by the end of it.\n\nEven on a Tuesday it can be busy at lunch so I'd recommend going early, but people finish quickly so getting a seat isn't difficult.\n\nWill definitely be back to try the menu on other days.","date":"2022-12-18T22:00:31.565Z"}
