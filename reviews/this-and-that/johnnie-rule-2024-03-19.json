Food was amazing and tasty and some of the best Indian I have had. Even better than a few expensive Indian resturants I have visited too.\nGreat for the price.\nSet expectations if you visit. It is like visiting your grandparents and having dinner and sitting down amongst family. Very welcoming quick to help.\nWill be going again.","date":"2024-03-19T10:47:02.875Z"}
