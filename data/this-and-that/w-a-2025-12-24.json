Hard to spot if you didn’t know what you was looking for but once you find it, the place will become your second home\n\nKing of the three curries & rice and a side order of seekh kebabs is highly recommended\n\nValue for money, plenty of seating & the staff are friendly\n\nService is quick and simple, so good I eat in them order a second one ne to take home",
