I trusted my friend as she was very excited to show me best curry place . I won't say this is the best curry I have ever had but it must be the only available best in town .my whole score is to their atmosphere.how welcoming and friendly environment they have for all communities.clean place ,food was warm and fresh ,quick service. If you in town and want have warm samosa or naan,then I highly recommend it these 2 items from their menu.","date":"2024-09-21T06:31:32.178Z"}
