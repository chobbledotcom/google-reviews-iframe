Not gonna lie, don't know the area. Read some reviews and found this place. Food was great, good portions for eat in and take out. The guys in there were friendly. Different selections of food each day. Mango lassi is awesome. Outside communal seating in the street only adds to the experience. Recommended.","date":"2022-08-02T19:38:00.183Z"}
