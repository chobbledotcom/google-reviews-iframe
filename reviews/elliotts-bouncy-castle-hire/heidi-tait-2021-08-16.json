I stumbled upon Elliots Bouncy Castles on a search engine and was very impressed…… dressed in a uniform and friendly and professional, arrived on time, double checked safety and explained everything…… Castle was clean and well maintained, pickup was as arranged and all went smoothly, will definitely use again…. Thankyou",
