  "content": "I’ve visited this restaurant around 14:00 on a weekday. There’s quite a large seating area and it’s pretty clean.\nThey have different menu on each weekday. I have ordered a lamp curry from the daily menu with a garlic naan (total £7.80 which I believe is a good deal for a good meal). I’m glad the gentleman working at the cashier has stopped me ordering 2 naan as he afraid that I might be too full. The temperature of the food is hot enough and the portion is just right! 🫶🏻\n\nWe are definitely going to visit again and recommend to our friends.",
