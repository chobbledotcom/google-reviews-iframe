It’s literally so easy to miss, it’s hidden away in the corner of a dark narrow street. We had rice and three meats: chicken tikka masala, lamb nih-something and keema - the minced beef. Everything was absolutely delicious, soft and melt-in-your mouth texture with incredible flavour. The place itself had a very canteen-like atmosphere with people sitting down with plates filled with food they got at the till. The naan was also great but not the best naan I’ve had. Also everything was priced so reasonably!! A plate of rice with three meats and a naan came to 9.80£. I’m most definitely coming back!!!","date":"2024-06-16T21:00:47.131Z"}
