Omg.....just about the best curry I've ever eaten !!. Really succulent lamb , nicely spiced , and a hot naan. This is now my  'go to'  curry house when I'm in the Northern Quarter....which is weekly !. You can sit inside - which is quite basic , with bench seating , or get a take-out ( no deliveries unfortunately). Highly recommended by myself and everyone i know who has tried their food.","date":"2025-07-20T18:43:15.033Z"}
