The portion was huge, definitely enough for ppl who are starving. There was a generous amount of meat in the curry, and the lamb was especially impressive with its extreme tenderness. HIGHLY recommend ppl who eat lamb to try their lamb dishes!!! Both chicken and lamb curry were spicy but great for those who need some heat on these chilly days. The mixed vegetable curry was kinda sweet, great to have it with spicy flavours.\n\nA MUST in this restaurant is definitely the mango lassi. Ppl who love lassi PLEASE order it, you will not regret it (or else you will be regretful 🤣) this is the BEST lassi I’ve had in my entire life. Thick and smooth, rich and creamy, and right point of the sweetness and sourness… can’t explain how good it was, and how happy I was when I had a sip of it.\n\nOverall, this is a place I would recommend visiting if you are in Manchester. This place feels like the kitchen in your house (family atmosphere) It was quite crowded around 12:30, but there were still abundant seats.","date":"2024-08-20T14:02:59.771Z"}
