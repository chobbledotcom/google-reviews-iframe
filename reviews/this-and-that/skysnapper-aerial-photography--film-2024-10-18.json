My son always raves about it & insisted on taking me. All he did was tell me not to judge the place by what the premises look like outside. We visited on a Saturday evening and within 45 mins of closing. I have to be honest, on turning into Soap Street and seeing the restaurant front I didn’t hold out for much. On entering the premises there was a healthy amount of people sat down eating their food, as well as people queueing up to order. The servery looked like a school dinner counter, but well stocked with piping hot food. The lady who served us was very pleasant and advised us on what each dish was. I chose Chicken Tikka masala, Keema curry, chicken curry & rice, with a side of a garlic naan. I’m a spicy food lover, so was a bowl of pencil chilli’s to add to my dish.\nWe took our seats on the provided benches & tucked into our food. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food for the £7 we paid for our plate full. The food was lovely, the staff were all chatty & happy to engage in conversation & banter.\nTo summarise, don’t judge a place based on its appearance.\nThoroughly enjoyed my visit & will definitely go again.\nThe only negative I can think of, is that they have a Man U crest on the wall, which made me feel nauseous when eating. 😂😂","date":"2024-10-18T18:23:44.962Z"}
