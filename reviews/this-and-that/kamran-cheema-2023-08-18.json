Lamb was soft and succulent, rice fresh, potatoes were starchy, fluffy and at decent temperature. Only problem, for the price, the portion is not acceptable. We liked the food but I’ll be honest we all ended up going else where to eat.\n\nThe lamb karahi wasn’t for me, too much tomato purée, the masala was bland and to be quite honest the curry’s in general don’t have a kick at all. 👍 🤷‍♂️","date":"2023-08-18T01:06:36.362Z"}
