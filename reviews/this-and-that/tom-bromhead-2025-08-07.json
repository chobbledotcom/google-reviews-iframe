No frills, extremely friendly staff (guessing most are family).  Genuinely interested in customers. Food was very tasty and will come again if we visit.  They run out of some items towards closing time so I would get there an hour before closing.  It’s off the main road down a lane so it’s a little hidden.  :)","date":"2025-08-07T15:05:57.536Z"}
