So I gave it a go. It's set in a side street, a bit unpleasant at first, but it serves it purpose. If you want curry in a hurry and a fair price with that homemade taste, then it's a great little spot. Various ranges of meat and veg curries are available depending on which day you go in. We had the 2 meat and 1 veg option with 2 roti and a can of coke. Cost £17.50 and it totally filled us up for the day. Give it a go, it's different.","date":"2023-07-22T22:17:26.821Z"}
