For £7.00, the 2 meat curries and 1 veg curry are amazing, quick service, with a new selection of curries everyday. I have honestly lost track of the amount of times me and my friends have visited this and that, never had a bad experience.\n\nI'd recommend the mixed vegetable curry, along with the lamb and carrots and chicken curry.","date":"2024-07-17T13:27:06.641Z"}
