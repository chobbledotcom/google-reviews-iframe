We’d seen a lot of positive reviews and we both love curries so thought why not. It was quite busy inside once we arrived but we found a table fairly quickly. The decor isn’t up market but for the price of the meal, you can’t expect the ritz. Customer service was fair and quick too.\n\nNow let’s talk food! The curries weren’t spicy enough for our taste, but they do have a self help onion, chilli and coriander bowel next to the till if you want to add more spice and flavouring. The lamb was really good and so was the chicken. Portions were big with a huge serving of rice underneath the curries. We also ordered vegetable samosas which were really good. However the garlic naan we ordered tasted funny with an artificial bright yellow colouring to it. We wouldn’t order it again and will opt for a plain naan.\n\nOverall it’s definitely my new go to curry spot after a busy day of shopping or work. It’s perfect solo, with a partner or with friends. There’s something for everyone.","date":"2022-03-03T12:40:01.443Z"}
