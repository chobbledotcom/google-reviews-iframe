  "content": "What a wonderfully well run family business with as they say the personal touch, we had a childrens party starting later in the day and we just needed the castle for that little bit longer, we just made 1 call and put it in the comments when we ordered online. They were more than happy to help. To go with that, the price was the best in the area for the style of castle we wanted and they just love what they do, so our children had a fantastic day. Would recommend them to everyone and will book them time and time again. Thank you to you both.",
