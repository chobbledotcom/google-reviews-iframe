The food is more thrown out than served, but it's very tasty and there is a good choice. It's ready as soon as you walk in so no waiting. £8 for rice & 3 with chapati is a little steep, but it's the city centre! Not somewhere you'd go on a date, but great on your own or for a small group who want good food fast.","date":"2022-12-13T12:48:30.476Z"}
