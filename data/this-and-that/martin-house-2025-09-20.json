Both my friends & I were blown away by the fabulous delicious home cooked food, friendly hospitable service, great value for money & basic but relaxed dining experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the This & That & next time in Manchester this is definately where I will be dining. Although different from the restaurant food most folk will be used to, I have to say that this traditional home cooked buffet style dining is in every way preferable to me,, it is proper indian food, just as it should be & I cannot wait to go back.\nThank you to all at the This & That,,,, it was way beyond my expectations 👍🤗\n\nJust been here again. Same story, it was great.","date":"2025-09-20T09:21:29.892Z"}
