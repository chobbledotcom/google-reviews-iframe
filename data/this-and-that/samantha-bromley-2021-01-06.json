My husband normally has this with the lads at work as a treat on lates once in a while. As the Christmas holidays were upon us. I decided to sample it myself, with the husband tagging along of course ;) I think he would be furious if I left him out, as it is now one of his firm favourites. I have to say, I was completely sold from the first month full. Amazing quality, quantity and value for money. You don't often see those three words in the same sentence. I can't wait to try this again and sample some more delights.","date":"2021-01-06T16:13:19.792Z"}
