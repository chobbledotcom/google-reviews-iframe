Came here on a recommendation and I'm so glad we did. I had the Keema (which was amazing), Chicken Tikka and the potatoe and cauliflower and an onion bhaji on the side. All very tasty and it really is worth a visit you are nearby. Lastly the staff/owners were very friendly and were super welcoming even though they were rushed off their feet!","date":"2022-04-09T20:52:41.325Z"}
