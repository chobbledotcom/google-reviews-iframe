Great food and great portion which you won't expected in other resturants in town, esp in such a downtown area. I had lamb and chicken which were really tender and nice. The lamb meat is juicy and tender and tasty, not too spicy. What impressed is the owner who worked in the shop for 35 years and still working during Covid. Even he mentioned the customers were only half of the crowd, he still keeps the same quality of the food. He worth our applause and respect.","date":"2021-03-09T21:19:30.203Z"}
