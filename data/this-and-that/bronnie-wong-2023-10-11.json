We ordered rice with chicken curry, lamb curry and cabbage for £8.50. Good portion size and was delicious! The lamb curry was spicier than I expected but tender and good.\n\nAtmosphere wise it’s like a canteen with plenty of seats to enjoy your meal with friends. Overall the food was good and afforable, highly recommend trying it out if you fancy a simple and casual meal!","date":"2023-10-11T01:29:14.939Z"}
