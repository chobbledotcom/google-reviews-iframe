Generous plates of curries and rice for less than a tenner. Order a naan too and it still won't make it over a tenner.\n\nThe curries aren't life changing, but they have a real sense of comfort - as if your grandma cooked them for you. They provide freshly chopped chillies, onions, and coriander to help brighten your food up.\n\nDaily changing menu, so come with a spontaneous spirit. Service was great too, very friendly and speedy. The dining room feels like you're eating on someone's living room - very cozy.\n\nIf you want affordable and tasty food, come here!","date":"2023-08-28T14:06:01.401Z"}
