They have different dishes everyday for you to choose from.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Nehari, Keema (minced meat) and Chana (Chick Peas) to go with my rice. Personally I love their Lamb Nehari the most as the lamb is so soft and just wonderful.\n\nI also highly recommend ordering the Mango Lassi. It is a mango flavored yoghurt drink priced at only £1. It goes well with the meal.","date":"2022-03-27T18:33:29.470Z"}
