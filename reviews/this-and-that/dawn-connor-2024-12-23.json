Located down an unlikely-looking back alley this restaurant serves delicious Indian food quickly and at a fantastic price.  The restaurant itself is not much to look at but that's not the point. Five pounds for a plate full of delicious vegetarian curries and rice is what it's all about. (Meat curries are available too). The menu changes each day and has a limited range of choices. Bulk cooking keeps the price down. The food is served up instantly on plastic plates. The people were very nice too.  It's a great place and I hope to be able to go there again soon.","date":"2024-12-23T23:26:08.404Z"}
