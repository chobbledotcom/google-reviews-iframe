Soap Street must be one of the scruffiest streets in the city centre and inside, it's almost what I imagine a soup kitchen would look like - \"decor\" is not a word that is in the least relevant to its internal appearance. And it's packed and busy and, if you're not use to how it works, you're going to learn very quickly. But don't let any of that put you off - a visit is well worth it and, having found it, I will be visiting again. The three curry and rice offer is excellent value for money at prices from £4.50 which includes a plate and a spoon! What can you get from Pret a Manger for £4.50? There were about 8 different curries to chose from - there is a fixed rota of curries for each day of the week. I had spinach and vegetables, chana and keema which were delicious but all of them looked very appetising. I had rice rather than a chapati but another time I will try the chapatis which looked superb. There is no way I could manage both. The food could have been a little hotter - it is kept hot in a buffet-style hot water counter - and the curry could have been a little spicier for my taste but, judging by the number of people in there and the speed with which the curries were going down, I am probably in a minority. Even so, there is plenty of it and it will not disappoint. In a way it wouldn't taste the same or be anything like as interesting if it were in different surroundings.","date":"2017-03-09T22:25:57.841Z"}
