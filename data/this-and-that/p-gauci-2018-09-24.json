The whole layout and building is very quirky and interesting - what a shame about the food.\n\nIt was supposed to be £4.50 for 2 portions of veg, 1 meat and a portion of rice. We ordered a plate each and a small plate of salad on the side - this came to £15!  The food was mediocre, there were four small pieces of lamb in the dish that I had and a similar amount in the chicken curry my girlfriend had.\n\nI was going to make a complaint but there was a large queue and I had to return to the car as the parking was running out. Left this place as hungry as when we entered and ended up going elsewhere. Wont be returning.","date":"2018-09-24T13:11:14.144Z"}
