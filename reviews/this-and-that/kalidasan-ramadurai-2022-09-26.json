Then I must say you haven't researched the places to eat in Manchester. If you read the reviews on trip advisor you will know what I mean. Place has been refurbished in the last year. They serve set items on set days. Their Dhal curry served on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays is my personal favorite. My friends who visit me from reading and Leeds love it as well.","date":"2022-09-26T09:58:01.423Z"}
