They even got rice and Naan Bread because the lovely Curries where a bit hot for them.\nI just have to write something to the bad review by Philippe Nieto. He ment that he gave the owner £30 (1 20£ note and 1 10£note) but the owner said that he gad given him only 2 10£. The owner said then they could find out a bit later by cheching the CCTV. Philippe startet shouting that he will give a bad review and throw his food on the floor and left the place making everybody realy uncomforble.","date":"2022-06-28T14:41:04.982Z"}
