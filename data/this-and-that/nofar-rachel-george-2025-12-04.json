  "content": "All the food was too spicy for me, but the vibe and service were great! I liked it that they were honest in telling me it's spicy, but also gave me a small sampling dish to see if I could handle it. It was so nice of them and I appreciate it. If I had more tolerance for spices, I'd definitely eat there often. Prices are also great, especially for the amount given.",
