Variety of dishes for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The food served is fresh and hygienic. The atmosphere of the place is very good and the staff is very polite and friendly. The place is usually busy during lunch and dinner times, if you are looking for cheap and wholesome food options just go for it.
