For £7, you get 3 curries & rice at a pretty generous portion. Shoutout to the rice, not sure what they do to make it but it was really good. Curries change everyday but you really can’t go wrong with any of the choices, just pick the ones that look interesting to you. Definitely recommend adding a mountain of onions like I do. Seating is small and the place feels cramped, but adds to the ambience in my opinion. One improvement I’d like to see is for them to be a bit more generous with the protein, but otherwise, a staple in my list of places to eat in Manchester👍","date":"2022-10-18T18:20:06.202Z"}
