I worked for a month in a hospital in India and the restaurant was very similar, however the curries here are much tastier! Food was obtained very quickly by queuing to select your curry. The prices are excellent (£6-7 for 3x curries and rice) and i left feeling very full as the portion size was generous! The people serving were very friendly and it's clear they want to make your experience enjoyable!\n\nWill definitely be back!","date":"2024-01-04T20:55:54.651Z"}
