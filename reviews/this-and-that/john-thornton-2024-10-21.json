The food tasted great. We had curries, rice and naans and left with empty plates - delicious and hot but not too hot.  The place is easy to miss, tucked down a side street but well worth a bit of searching. We liked that within 3 minutes of walking in we were eating.  Definitely a place to come back to 👍","date":"2024-10-21T19:17:39.356Z"}
