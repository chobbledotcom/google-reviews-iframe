Well worth hunting out (I ended up having to stoop to an all time low and speak to a traffic warden for directions, it's down alley by Trof in NQ) great food and flavours and not overly hot, great friendly service and a great price, what's not to like. Kids really liked it to and daughter not that fussed about Indian food usually. Will certainly be going back at some point.","date":"2021-11-06T23:47:58.488Z"}
