He even asked later on if we were full and if everything was good.\nI really recommend this place because the food is delicious and it's quite cheap while getting full.\nWe order two plates: 1/ rice, daal, potatoes and chicken chaana; 2/ rice, daal and chicken tikka masala. Plus garlic naan and a coke. Everything for £15. I will repeat in case of coming back to Manchester.","date":"2022-10-14T22:33:45.460Z"}
