We chose the 3 meat with rice for £8, we got keema and peas, chicken curry and chicken tikka and a plain naan for £1.50, all tasted amazing, perfectly cooked and very filling.\nThe real testament was how busy it is, the guy next to us said it was his third time this week, another said 2nd time this week.\nIf you're in Manchester this place is worth the visit.","date":"2025-05-13T12:15:19.677Z"}
