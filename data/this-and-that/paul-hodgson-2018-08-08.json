No frills but unbelievable value. 4 curries and rice on one plate for £5.50. We arrived at 16:15 and had the same choice as on the menu. Fresh cooked rice whilst we waited. Friendly staff who certainly know how to make you welcome. Huge portions at low prices, I'll be back next time I'm oop north!!","date":"2018-08-08T08:07:45.285Z"}
