Ordered some kebabs and chapatti earlier for my tea on my way home from work When I got them home and tasted them I was shocked. Nothing at all like chicken kebabs and was more like minced chicken with some thing that looked like peppers inside. Definitely won't be returning. Sorry","date":"2021-04-19T16:04:17.046Z"}
