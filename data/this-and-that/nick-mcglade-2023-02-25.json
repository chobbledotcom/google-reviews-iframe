Went after hearing nothing but good things about “Manchester’s hidden gem” which boats the best curry in town. Blown away by not just the quality of the food, but how nice the owners were. After hearing it was my first UK curry experience, they were kind enough to give me extras to try, letting me experience it all.\n\nDidn’t want to post this review because I want to keep it all to myself but it’s a must visit in Manchester for food, atmosphere, and just good people","date":"2023-02-25T19:23:27.528Z"}
