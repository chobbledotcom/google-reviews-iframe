The service was really good however the naan bread took a good few minutes to come out and we already had the curries so it was either wait and the food go cold or start and eat the bread without the food. The naan was cooked fresh so will know to order that first next time. There will definitely be a next time as the food was spot on as was the price.","date":"2025-02-19T20:30:05.568Z"}
