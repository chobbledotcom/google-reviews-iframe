You wouldn’t notice it if you didn’t have the intention of finding it. Small place (I don’t imagine the outside has changed since the 80s!), basic set-up: you go up and get your rice and 3 main items. £7 for rice, 1 veg and 2 meats. Can put as many white onions, chillis and coriander on your plate as you like at the end. They also sell samosas, pakoras, naans etc. All really fresh and flavourful food - in particular I’d recommend the keema. Staff also had a smile on their face. Solid stuff, I intend to come back!","date":"2024-10-06T11:13:05.409Z"}
