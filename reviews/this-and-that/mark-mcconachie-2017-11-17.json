Certainly one of the longest established. I have been coming here for 30 years. First under the ownership of Iqbal, then under Mr Maloo, the same standards of cuisine have been maintained. Rice and three curries is the staple fare during Mon to Sat; the menu items differ each day. Sunday sees the best dish of all though - nehari. A sublime slow-cooked lamb dish. All done for keen prices. Highly recommended.","date":"2017-11-17T00:09:59.929Z"}
