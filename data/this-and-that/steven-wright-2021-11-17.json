Delicious food that is quick and convenient. Daily menu is on a board on the wall and essentially you buy three dishes and rice for £6.00. On my last visit I had lamb chops, chicken curry, daal, a chapati and rice for £6.30. Opened in 1984 and as popular as ever.","date":"2021-11-17T13:45:59.108Z"}
