The place is hidden in a rundown alley of Manchester and with construction work around it’s tougher to locate this place but once you find the treasure, you are in for a treat. It’s a must try place of people who want to enjoy Pakistani cuisine on a budget.\n\nValue: Super cheap! My rice and 3 curries along with Diet Coke costed me 9 quid. That’s it. The portion size is big so you aren’t paying a bomb for bite size plates.\n\nLocation: Heart of the city yet quite secluded. A 3 minutes walk from Arndale, as mentioned earlier, this place is hidden. The walk to this place may look all dingy but this is most of the hidden places in Manchester alleys!\n\nFood: They have a set menu where you have option to pick 3 out of almost 6-8 curries. You have chicken, lamb and vegetarian/ vegan options as well. On top of that you can pay more for starters (mostly samosa and bhajiyas) and soft drink.\n\nService : The staff is friendly and welcoming. A canteen/mess feel to the place.\n\nAdvice to management: A little more on hygiene will be great like adding gloves and hair caps but overall great.\n\nA must visit especially a steal during these times of high inflated market with rising cost of living.","date":"2022-10-18T11:56:29.961Z"}
