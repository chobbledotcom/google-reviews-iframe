  "content": "This & That Restaurant in Manchester is truly a hidden gem, as it's tucked away from the busy main areas. The concept is simple, you choose your dishes and the staff serve the curries you want.\n\nThe food is filling and satisfying. Even though the restaurant looks simple, almost like a canteen, it's always busy with customers who clearly enjoy the food and keep coming back because the menu suits their taste well.\n\nThe staff are friendly and always smiling, which adds to the pleasant dining experience. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for good, affordable food 🍲. Highly recommend😉",
