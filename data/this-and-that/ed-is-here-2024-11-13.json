The rice was perfectly cooked and fragrant, with a generous portion that’s both filling and satisfying. It came with three delicious side dishes, each full of authentic spices and rich flavors that complemented the briyani beautifully. The best part is the affordability—great quality and taste without breaking the bank! Highly recommended for anyone craving a tasty and budget-friendly Indian meal.","date":"2024-11-13T00:13:15.194Z"}
