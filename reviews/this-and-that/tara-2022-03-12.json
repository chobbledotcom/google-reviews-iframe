From the moment my friend and I walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and a smile.  It was nearly closing time but that was not a problem to them at all.  We explained we had never been before and the lovely gentleman kindly said what they had to offer which was lamb mine curry, vegetable curry and chicken curry...... yes please!\nA younger gentleman with a huge smile said, please sit down ladies and we'll bring it over.\nQuickly or\nOur food arrived again with a huge smile from a friendly chap who asked if we would like any breads with our food, again yes please!\nNow I'm from Bradford known as the curry capital and I've eaten many, many curries from back street curries to Mumtaz and this was what I like to call an authentic curry.  So full of flavour, just delicious and at £7.50, well you can't beat it.\nSo please 🙏🏽 pop in for the warmest of welcomes and leave with the fullest of tummies and you will not be disappointed.","date":"2022-03-12T10:00:43.013Z"}
