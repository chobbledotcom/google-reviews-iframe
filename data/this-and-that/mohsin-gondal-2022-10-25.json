One of the few places, where you can find such flavourful food. All the curies are really good. In the heart of Manchester, almost in the middle of City Center, next to the Manchester Arndale, but still some times hard to find, Manchester's Hidden Gem for many reasons. There three cury snd rice is something in which you can get different flavours, spices and a mix of veg and meat. So, what else you can ask for in a single meal in such a reasonable price. You are going to find such good food, in a place you least expected. What else you can ask for. And it is there for decades since 1984.\nHighly recommended if you like to have authentic Indian/desi food.","date":"2022-10-25T10:42:05.814Z"}
