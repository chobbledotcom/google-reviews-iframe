I had rice and three veg - they were all very tasty and can’t go wrong for £6! My partner enjoyed his meat curries. Two rice and three, a garlic naan, one samosa and two cans for £19.30! You’re not getting food this good anywhere else in town for that price! Just wish I’d been sooner. Can’t wait to come back. Really friendly staff! Other people were having chapati’s and mango lassi’s and they looked really good.","date":"2025-01-03T22:17:01.905Z"}
