  "content": "Fantastic from start to finish. Rebecca in the office was so patient when I was dithering over what we should have and she has continued to be helpful right to the end. We booked the bucking bronco, bouncy castle and assault course for our Y6 leavers party. \nThey arrived on time and got on with setting up, Graham, Kane and Tom were absolutely brilliant with the children and were a pleasure to deal with and are a credit to the company.  I would recommend to all and would definitely book them again. 5 star plus!!",
