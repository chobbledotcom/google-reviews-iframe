Don't let the plastic chairs and Formica tables put you off, the food is amazing. Nothing like your usual Indian restaurant, these curries are proper, no-nonsense, delicious and spicy. Feels like authentic food. Always a choice with good veggie selection. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!","date":"2019-03-16T18:30:32.036Z"}
