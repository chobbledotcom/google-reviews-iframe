Changes each day, and to be honest, half the time, I have no clue what curry they are, but they're all so nice. Some are slightly spicier than others, so if you can't eat spicy food, then make sure to ask.\nPortion sizes are large for the price, and the curries are delicious.\n\nMango lassi is also available by the glass - just ask for it when you pay at the counter.","date":"2024-08-30T15:22:38.899Z"}
