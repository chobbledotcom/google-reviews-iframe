Some of the best South Asian food I've eaten in recent memory (beware though, can be spicy for some)! The mango lassi and the garlic naan were both also delicious and highly recommended. Absolutely fantastic food and taste, at an incredible price and served with a smile and great attitude from the staff - thanks Mo and team! Excellent model of restaurant and I wish you another 40 years of success and beyond. What a hidden gem that I will forever recommend to everyone!","date":"2023-11-19T23:26:50.606Z"}
